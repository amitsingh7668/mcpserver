Event-Driven:
- Horizontal scaling: Add more Audit Service instances
- Handle 1K → 100K messages/sec by adding consumers
- Kafka/Event Hub handles backpressure automatically
- Independent scaling of producer/consumer

CDC (Blob Notifications):
- Limited by blob storage event throughput
- Harder to control concurrency
- More prone to throttling
